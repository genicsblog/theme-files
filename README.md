Theme files for genicsblog.com

**This is not a proper Jekyll theme**. This repo contains only the theme files that genicsblog.com's repo retrevies at GitHub action's runtime to build the site.

## Local setup

Please install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (preferrably 3.x) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (preferrably 16.x) before you proceed.

Run the `dev.sh` script in order to set up the local environment and build the website:

```shell
./dev.sh
```

The first build would take a few moments. Once done, you can preview the site at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). Subsequent builds should be faster.

If any problem persists, try providing the correct permissions to the bash script by running:

```shell
chmod +x dev.sh
```

Now you should be able to run the `./dev.sh` command.
