Genics Blog is an [open source platform](https://github.com/genicsblog) for developers to share technical knowledge. You will generally find us posting high quality relevant content in the niche of software development or programming in general.

We post two types of content:

- **Original content** that is written by us or by the developers who submit their original content to us.
- **Cross posts** that constitute relevant articles from other sources, submitted by the authors. **We post this only on the discrete permission of the author.** 

> Fun fact: We are a team of high schooler teenagers passionate about programming :P

Perks of writing at Genics Blog:

- Articles are shared within our community on discord and on twitter for a wider reach. You get special recognition on our discord server for your contributions.
- You get access to an inclusive community of passionate developers, with whom you can learn and grow.
- Your articles remain your own, so you can publish them at your own blog or website. The only limitation is for original content, please add a canonical link back to us. Otherwise it harms both your website and ours as well.
- Original content is eligible to get 2 quality backlinks to preferred website that will help in organic rankings of your own content.

We have an active community of developers and content writes on our [Discord server](https://discord.genicsblog.com) and [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/genicsblog). Being open source, the codebase on GitHub is actively maintained by community contributions.

## The team
